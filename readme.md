## Overview of the course

- Day 0
	- Registration, welcome and introductions ``Ghent``

- Day 1
	- Gaining insights into biological processes through phenotyping: what is phenotyping, what is it used for and how is it done? ``Ghent``- Day 2
	- Quantitative shoot growth analysis: on what the number and size of shoots, leaves and cells, as measured over time, can tell about underlying biological processes ``Ghent``- Day 3
	- Quantitative root system and root growth analysis: on what root system architecture and root growth can tell us about soil exploitation abilities of plants ``Louvain-la-Neuve``- Day 4
	- Plant phenotyping beyond growth assessment and lab environments: physiological and performance trait measurements in field environments ``Ghent``- Day 5
	- Exploration of the electromagnetic spectrum for the measurement or derivation of proxies for physiological plant traits ``Ghent``- Day 6
