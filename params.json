Phenotyping has long been the bottleneck and DNA sequencing has advance very quickly\r\n- Based on Google scholar occurence, plant genotyping has reached a plateau while phenotyping is in an exponential phase\r\n- Very different questions depending on the field (plant level, leaf level, molecular, hydraulics). All questions are valid and are related. The difficulty is tat all the traits can vary in time and space (not all at the same rate) and are interconnected. They all vary with genotype and environment\r\n- We need the help from computers to integrate everything: image analysis, modelling, stats. This is the new bottleneck.\r\n- When starting to make physiological experiment on Arabidopsis, it was difficult to have reproducible results. \r\n- For simple task (imaging, weighting, watering), robot can do it, we do not need post-docs to do it\r\n- Building of phenotyping platform ([PHENOPSIS](http://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/phenopsis/)) (Granier et al. 2006)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/embo_phenotyping/master/images/phenopsys.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Need homogeneous conditions for all the plants. This is of outmost importance, as it will influence the results really heavily. Need to check between every experiment. \r\n- It is important to think about the management of the platform on te long term (good technicians)\r\n- Even with the exact same protocole, results will be different across groups (Massonnet et al 2010).\r\n- Need to have sensors (light, temp, hum) close to the plants to track the local envi changes. These local change can change the output of the experiment.\r\n\t- leaf expansion is highly sensible to incident light levels\r\n\t- leaf expansion is highly sensitive to Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n- This variability calls for automation of the growth and measurement processes\r\n- Automated technique improve the reproducibility (Baerenfaller et al 2012), so they allow to compare genotypes and treatments\r\n- Traits vary overtime during devpmt. When to compare plant traits?\r\n- leaf growth is a very dynamic process. It is impossible to predict final leaf stage with only one measurement at one date. (Lievre et al. 2013, Dapp et al 2015)\r\n- Now that we have a robot, is is possible to increase the diversity of measured traits (going down to cellular traits)?\r\n- When you combien a large number of traits / genotype / envi, you need new tools to make sense of your data. Integration with statisticians, modellers, ...

However, when using them, ones has to pay attention to several aspects. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the phenotyping strategy is heavily dependent on the question at hand. There is not universal phenotyping solution that can answer all the question. It need to be adapted to the specific needs. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is important to keep in mind that phenotyping in controlled environment is only the beginning. The challenge is to go from the greenhouse to the field, in which the plant will be facing multiple stresses at the same time (both biotic and abiotic). Getting feedback from the fields trails is crucial, to be sure to be looking for the right traits. \r\n\r\nFinally, an other challenge is to integrate the wealth of data generated both by the platforms and in the fields. Since the scales are different, the sensors and measured data are likely to be different as well, which makes the integration difficult.\r\n\r\n> From an industry point of view, phenotyping needs to be cost effective, which is often hard to measure. Ideally, each euro that goes into the phenotyping platform has to come out. As such, the precision of the phenotyping pipeline is key has it can increase the number of hit characterisation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### From phenotyping to model-assisted phenotyping, or how to get more from your data\r\n\r\n[Xavier Draye](http://uclouvain.be/xavier.draye) | [UCL](https://www.uclouvain.be/ecav.html) | Louvain-la-Neuve\r\n\r\n\tChecked by the speaker\r\n\t\r\n- Linking phenotyping and models to get more out of your data\r\n- The way you carry out phenotyping reflects a conceptual model.  \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/embo_phenotyping/master/images/root.png)\r\n\r\n- Phenotyping: measuring everything (many variables) about nothing (one signle plant)? Or nothing (one variable) about everything (many plants)?\r\n- Yoav Weisel: Root systems can be considered as populations of roots. You can sample within the root population instead of measuring the whole population.\r\n- new conceptual model lead to other phenotyping strategies    \r\n    - length -> growth\r\n    - number of laterals -> inter-lateral distance function\r\n    - ...\r\n    \r\n- High-throughput root phenotyping in aeroponics [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eImg9IobXGE)\r\n    - High throughput, high resolution time lapse imaging\r\n    - elongation\r\n    - emergence\r\n    - angle / tropism\r\n    - dynamics\r\n\r\n- New phenotyping strategies enable new imaging analysis tools\r\n    - root system are complex, you can not get everything. So you get what you can, filter it to reduce false positive and keep the rest (again, this is sampling)\r\n- Sampling-based image analysis requires further data mining pipelines to sort out the different data\r\n\r\n> Be aware of your conceptual model, even if it is implicit!\r\n\r\n- Different root model co-exists\r\n    - Archisimple (Pagès et al 2013)\r\n    - Topological indices (Fitter 1987)\r\n    - FSPM's (Godin and Sinoquet 2005)\r\n    - Density based (Dupuy et al. 2005)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Models to estimate the un-measurable\r\n- Case study: Water saving from a soil-root perspective\r\n    - when you start modelling you move to processes\r\n    - explicitly acknowledge non-linear nature of soil-root processes\r\n- Modeling can help assess non-linear, multi scale processes (such as water uptake)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/embo_phenotyping/master/images/wateruptake.png)\r\n\r\n- Model are always wrong by nature. They can only give you what you wrote  in it. But they can help tackle complex processes\r\n- [RSWMS model](http://sites.uclouvain.be/RSWMS/)(Javaux et al 2008)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillaumelobet/embo_phenotyping/master/images/rswms.png)\r\n\r\n- Light transmission imaging tracks the evolution of soil water content (Garrigues et al 2006)\r\n- Models can help you access hidden parameters. As long as you have enough experimental data to fit your model correctly. \r\n- The complexity of your system can be an opportunity\r\n- Case study: variability of radial root conductance\r\n    - three different logics\r\n        - structure\r\n        - apoplastic barriers\r\n        - aquaporin expressions\r\n    - Again, models help you integrate the different logics \r\n- Radial root model of water flow\r\n    - you feed-in the root structure, the expression patterns and you get the radial conductance by inverse modelling\r\n\r\n- Take home: thinking about your biological target as a dynamic system brings knowledge into the phenotyping process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n-[Draye, X., Kim, Y., Lobet, G., & Javaux, M.

If you measure a lot of stuff, you will have correlation. Then you have to make sense of them.\r\n\r\n- if you want to know about classical growth analysis analysis, [read this author](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Poorter%2C%20Hendrik%5BAuthor%5D)\r\n If you want to read more about the mathematical basis for kinematic analyses [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=silk%2C+wendy%5BAuthor%5D) \r\n\r\n- Lagrangian perspective: individual particle. View from a single cell progressing in time\r\n- Eulerian perspective: spatial perspective. Look from the outside\r\n\r\n- Growth is an exponential process (you produce leaf, get light, then produce more leaves, get more light, ...)\r\n\r\n- Looking at the growth data of whole plant or dicotyledonous leaves on a log scale brings a completely different (more correct) view. \r\n\r\n- Root growth is \"text-book\" example of kinematic analysis\r\n\r\n- Tracking particles in growing roots allows you of retrieve velocity profile along the roots. Then the derivative is the cell division -> very precise information about the biological processes\r\n\r\n- maize leaf is very similar system as the root as it is also linear.\r\n\r\n- kinematic dataset give you information about you samplings strategy. It can help you define the different zone in the growth curves. Be careful to sample equivalent tissues in root / leaf (at the same developmental stage)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Kinematic analysis is maybe more laborious and less glorious, but can help in your analysis, giving you the cellular basis of growth differences and location/timing when differences are occurring, which allows to design appropriate sampling strategies for molecular analyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### References \r\n\r\n- [Green, P.
